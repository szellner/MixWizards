“Three-tenths liquid gold… one-fifth pixie dust… and… wait. Wait. <br>
There’s a smudge here… I really can’t tell how much… yep. Of course. <br>
It’s just my luck to get the <i>one</i> book that doesn’t tell you how to make Rising Sun Elixirs. <br>
Perfect! This is going to take forever to figure out…”
<br><br>
Welcome to <b>MixWizards</b>, a magical, math-filled mixing game. As an inexperienced but ambitious young wizard or witch, you’ve studied hard and learned all you can about ratios -- and your efforts have been noticed. Finally! You’ve been asked to make a large assortment of potions of various types, sizes, and concentrations for the upcoming World Championship Wizarding Duels, the biggest event of the year. <br><br>
As soon as you begin, though, you realize that the potions you must make are far more complex than any you’ve seen before. 
In a panic, you rush to the library. They have all the books you need, but they are absolutely ancient. Pages are falling out, and the ones that are left are full of holes and filled with stains. Basically all the instructions on how to make the potions are incomplete. <br><br> 
Drat! 
<br><br>
It’s your job to figure out what the missing information is based on the rest of the recipe, but the clues it gives are often puzzling. You must use the knowledge you’ve gained in class about ratios to solve the problem -- then strategize how to use the ingredients you have so you can mix all the potions. But not all ingredients can be used the way you get them! Some must be boiled or frozen, and it’s pretty tricky to figure out how long you should leave them in for. If they aren’t prepared just right, the potion won’t work. 
<br><br>
As the game proceeds, ingredients become more scarce and recipes harder to decipher. New recipes begin to be unlocked as you progress, challenging you to become an expert potion-mixer. Now, what are you waiting for? There’s no time to waste! You sure have a lot of potions to make…

###Synopsis (tl;dr)
An iOS6 iPad game created to help elementary school students practice ratio reasoning problems, strengthening their problem-solving skills and confidence using various solution methods. 

###Motivation
With pure word problems, students are inclined to look only for the numbers and then plug them into known equations without much thought. Often, they lack intuition about how these problems relate to the real world; our game provides that missing link by visually representing ratio-based problems. Gameplay encourages students to better connect the requirements of a word problem that they may see in
school with real-life situations and vice versa. Our aim is to foster long-term mathematical literacy and academic confidence by strengthening students' problem-solving and ratio reasoning skills in a fun, engaging, and challenging way. 

###User Testing
In December 2013, we tested our beta with our target group: approximately thirty grade six students at a local Pomona middle school. Our game was well-recieved on every front and students' suggestions aligned (strangely) perfectly with all previously-considered improvements to the game. We received excellent feedback about user interface changes, details that needed tweaking, and the direction in which we should continue. 

###About Our Team
This game was developed by a team of four junior-year computer science majors at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, CA over the the course of roughly a semester and a half. The game started as the final project for CS121 (Large Software Development) and then as the subject of an Advanced Problems in Computer Science course with our professor and former CS department chair Mike Erlinger. 

###Details
Coded in Objective-C using the Cocos2D framework and open-source libraries, including <a href="https://github.com/lomanf/PaperStack">PaperStack</a>.
